# Athena web app

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

## Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com/teamrevspace/athena-web.git athena-web
cd athena-web
yarn install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                       # README file
â”œâ”€â”€ __mocks__                       # Mocks for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ .github                         # GitHub folder
â”œâ”€â”€ .husky                          # Husky configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode                         # VSCode configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public                          # Public assets folder
â”œâ”€â”€ src

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages                       # Next JS Pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages.test                  # Next JS Pages tests (this avoids tests to be treated as a Next.js pages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles                      # Styles folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates                   # Default template

â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js              # Tailwind CSS configuration
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript configuration
```

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: sitemap configuration

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit ðŸš€.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
yarn commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also remove unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
yarn build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.

### Deploy to Vercel

Deploy this Next JS Boilerplate on Vercel in one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fteamrevspace%2Fathena-web)

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
